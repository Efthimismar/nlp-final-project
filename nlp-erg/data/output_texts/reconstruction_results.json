    "During our final discuss, I told him about the new submission — the one we were waiting since last autumn, but the updates \nwas confusing as it not included the full feedback from reviewer or maybe editor? Anyway, I believe the team, although bit \ndelay and less communication at recent days, they really tried best for paper and cooperation. We should be grateful, I mean \nall of us, for the acceptance and efforts until the Springer link came finally last week, I think. Also, kindly remind me please,\n if the doctor still plan for the acknowledgments\n section edit before he sending again. Because I didn’t see that part final yet, or maybe I missed, I apologize if so. Overall, \n let us make sure all are safe and celebrate the outcome with strong coffee and future targets."
